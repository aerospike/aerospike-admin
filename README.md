# Aerospike Admin

## Description
Aerospike Admin provides an interface for Aerospike users to view the stat
of their Aerospike Cluster by fetching information from a running cluster (Cluster mode) 
a collectinfo file (Collectinfo-Analyzer), or logs (Log-analyser mode).
Start the tool with *asadm* and run the *help* command to get started.

## Installing Aerospike Admin
### Runtime Dependencies
There are no runtime dependencies.  This is because the python interpreter is now 
bundled with asadm version 2.6 and later.

1. Install python 3.9
2. Install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)

sudo make
sudo make install
```

## Running Aerospike Admin in Live Cluster Mode.
```
asadm -h <Aerospike Server Address\>

## Tests

### Setting Test Environment
asadm has unit and e2e tests. To setup environment for e2e tests, execute following steps:
- Enable security in the aerospike.conf file.
- Verify that the default user `admin` exists and that is has the default roles: `sys-admin`, `user-admin`, and `read-write`. 
- Start Aerospike cluster: Test machine should be part of this cluster with 3000 as asinfo port.
- Write a few records to cluster `asbenchmark -h <host> -Uadmin -Padmin`
- Wait for a few seconds so cluster can return histogram output properly.

### Running Tests
```
pipenv
./run_tests.sh
```
